## What's in it

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **FocusDim** | Dims every window except the one you're working in. Multi-monitor. |
| **QuickBoard** | Clipboard manager. Stores 100+ items, full-text search, auto-paste. |
| **Liquid Focus** | Pomodoro timer with Todoist integration and webcam focus detection. |
| **SoundSplit** | Per-app volume sliders with real-time VU meters. |
| **ScreenSlap** | Full-screen meeting alerts from Google Calendar. One-click join for Zoom, Meet, Teams, Webex. |
| **MeetReady** | Camera and mic check before meetings. Shows video preview, mic levels, lighting quality. |
| **Dashboard** | Hub that launches everything else. Install only the tools you want. |

FocusDim and SoundSplit use Win32 APIs directly through FFI (koffi), not Electron overlays. The webcam focus tracker runs TensorFlow.js face detection on-device. Nothing leaves your machine.

## Tech stack

- Electron 33 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.7
- Vite 6 via electron-vite
- Tailwind CSS 4
- koffi (FFI for Win32: `GetForegroundWindow`, `DwmGetWindowAttribute`, `SendInput`)
- TensorFlow.js + BlazeFace (on-device face detection)
- PowerShell sidecar for WASAPI audio control (SoundSplit)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inchwormz/peakflow-electron.git
cd peakflow-electron
npm install
```

Copy the env template and add your own API credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You need a Todoist app and Google OAuth client if you want calendar/task integrations. Both use PKCE, so no client secret is needed for Google. The Todoist secret goes in `.env`.

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build:win    # NSIS installer → release/
npm run build:unpack # Unpacked build for testing → release/win-unpacked/
npm run typecheck    # Check types (main + renderer)
npm run lint         # ESLint
```

## Contributing

Open an issue before submitting a PR. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome.

If you're adding a new tool, follow the existing pattern: service in `src/main/services/`, IPC channels in `ipc-handlers.ts`, React component in `src/renderer/src/tools/`.
